Task Overview:
You are a data science expert. Below, you are provided with a database schema and a natural language question.
Your task is to understand the schema and generate a valid SQL query to answer the question.

Database Engine:

Database Schema:
{{ schema }}
This schema describes the database's structure, including tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any relevant relationships or constraints.

Instructions:
- Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
- The generated query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
- Before generating the final SQL query, please think through the steps of how to write the query.
